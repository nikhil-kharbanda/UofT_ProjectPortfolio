Project: Homework Assign#2 - Personal Project Portfolio

In this project, I had made a personal portfolio webpage showcasing my projects. I had made this project from scratch, and had learned a lot of cool features that I can use for further projects.

To meet this projects criteria, I had to:\
[X] Display my name at the top\
[X] Display a nav bar to links to sections at the top\
[X] Display all my projects\
[X] Display my contact information\
[X] Included hyperlink images to my contact pages\
[X] Made my nav bar link to sections\
[X] Made my first application project bigger than the other projects\
[X] Linked my first application webpage to the image (when image is clicked, open my first webpage in a different tab)\
[X] Made my portfolio webpage responsive (resizing it may look a messy when screen is small, but projects and nav bar responds properly)\
[X] Created an application link using GITHub pages

An image of my webpage can be found in the Assets/Demo folder (file name WorkingImg.gif) and in the readme on GitHub.
